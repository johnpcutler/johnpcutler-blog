Very basic product lesson. 

A family of five pledges to start eating healthy. They hire you to plant and maintain a small vegetable garden in their backyard. The initial project will take you two days. You figure ongoing maintenance will take about an hour per week. They agree to pay you $200 per month (effective at first harvest). 

You plant the basics: tomatoes, peppers, and squash.

Some problems begin to crop up. In your rush to plant the garden, you forgot to add suitable critter protection.
