#### Breaking Stuff and Home/Self Improvement

I like home improvement projects, but something always seems to go wrong.

I’ll be at the critical step and find out I don’t have the right tool — that odd wrench, solvent, or drill bit. Every bone in my body knows the right thing to do. Go to the hardware store! But nooo … I soldier on without the tool, and end up breaking something.
