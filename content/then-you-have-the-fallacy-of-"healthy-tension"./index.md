Then you have the fallacy of “healthy tension”. The theory is that you’ll get an optimal solution when engineering advocates for building things right, UX advocates for making it easy to use, and product advocates for getting it out the door. How often does this work in practice? You either end up with a middling attempt at compromise so everyone feels happy but the best idea loses, or the loudest voice (or HIPPO) wins. Don’t get me wrong — creative tension is a powerful design tool — but it requires a level of safety and respect that is often lacking in a matrixed environment. 

Matrixed organizations push the responsibility for synchronization up through the hierarchy. The only way to resolve mismatched priorities is to let the VPs or Directors hash it out.
