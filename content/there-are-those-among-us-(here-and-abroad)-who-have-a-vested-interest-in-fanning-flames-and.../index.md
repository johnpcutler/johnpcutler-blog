There are those among us (here and abroad) who have a vested interest in fanning flames, and deepening cultural divides. These individuals (and groups, and foreign states) want chaos. They want people to believe that our differences are irreconcilable, that facts are mutable, and that finding common ground is impossible. Their agenda is not compatible with compromise and pursuing shared outcomes, even if it benefits the American people.
