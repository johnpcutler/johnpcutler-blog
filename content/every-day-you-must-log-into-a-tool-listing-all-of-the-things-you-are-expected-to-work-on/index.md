-   Every day you must log into a tool listing all of the things you are expected to work on
-   You are expected to update your status on these tasks regularly, give a verbal summary at the drop of a hat, and for good measure repeat said status in frequent meetings. Everyone couple hours, someone is asking about how things are going, and how much more you have to do
-   No matter how hungover, tired, or grumpy you are, you are expected to stand around with your team for thirty minutes and talk in detail about what’s on your plate. Every day
-   You are held accountable for your “commitments” on a regular basis. If things “slip” you are forced to “renegotiate” said “commitments”…often by people whose sole “commitment” is to report your “status” to someone else
-   Good chunks of your day require intense collaboration with other people … either in person, on video calls, or using various tools (chat, github, etc.)
-   Your team’s progress is displayed on various charts/graphs. When the going is slow, people with nervous eyes disappear into conference rooms. Your progress is literally broadcasted and available to anyone, at any time
-   You are solving cost/benefit decisions the whole day. It is like glorious puzzle solving mixed with mind-numbing configuration/testing challenges and plumbing
-   Your work is done “open book”. Anyone with access to the repository can rip it apart. Your work is reviewed by your peers constantly.
-   When you spend time trying to get things right, folks tell you to not be a perfectionist. When you break something, you’re called sloppy. When you shoot for the middle, experienced coworkers always find something to gripe about.
-   There’s a never ending conveyor belt of “new features” coming down the line. People don’t seem to care _too much_ if they “work”, but they really care if you’re fast
-   In addition to your “regular” work, you are asked to monitor dozens of Slack channels related to engineering, deployment, tools, sub-systems, etc. There you encounter a steady barrage of notifications, requests, and questions
-   In addition to your “regular” work, there are a number of maintenance / troubleshooting tasks you undertake because it would be too annoying to advocate for making them “regular” work
-   At some regular interval, the team is expected to engage in continuous improvement rituals. When some gnarly root-cause is mentioned that is outside of the team’s scope of influence, that item somehow enters the ether. So you’re constantly reminded of what you can control, and what you can’t control…but are expected to absolutely optimize absolutely everything you can control
-   For the most part, every day — every week — every month — is structured the same way, with the same meetings, the same problems, the same pressure, and the same personalities

Most of my developer friends love what they do. They make great money, and love problems solving. It takes a special personality to
