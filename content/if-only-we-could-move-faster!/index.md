If only we could move faster!

An inability to move faster is _often_ linked to a history of poor product decision-making. The problem, however, is that these types of issues are typically far less visible than low velocity_,_ quality issues,  and the various dysfunctions that come with _dealing with that product decision-making history_ (e.g. optimizing around busyness, feature-soup, specialization, Tetris, handoffs, etc.)_._ At a certain point the symptoms take on a life of their own, and perversely start thwarting attempts to fix the underlying issue. The symptoms become the “big problem here”. 

By _product decision-making_ I am not referring solely to the flashy/sexy stuff like ruthless focus, positioning, and “product/market fit”. Of course these things matter a great deal and can sink the ship in a flurry of conflating symptoms. But you also have a range of “more tactical” (but equally important) challenges like problem decomposition, product development team dynamics, approaches to incremental development/delivery, research, validation and experiment design, and measurement. The “perfect idea ” and “great market opportunity” paired with a “highly talented engineering team” can still implode without this glue.

The glue is tough to pin down because it is inherently cross-functional, difficult to quantify, missing a single “wringable neck”, tough to gauge, and impervious to generalizations. Context matters. Which makes it very challenging to discuss…especially with leaders/executives. 

“Build the right thing / build the right thing right” makes intuitive sense and is easy to graft on to an org chart. The neat and tidy Venn diagrams and problem vs. solution dichotomies look comforting. But these models fail to cover all the meta-messiness. And I’ve never met an executive who has time (or patience) for the meta-messiness. “We just need to execute” is both right…and a gross generalization. 

Which brings us back to going fast.
