Brief post…

A salesperson friend explains one day:

> We don’t use target quotas at Acme. And we reliably beat our goals.

What goes through your mind? I tested this on a friend:

> Maybe with target quotas they would have done better! I’ve found salespeople highly motivated by sales targets.

A newly “in shape, I’ve lost 40lbs in the last two months” friend explains their workout regime:

> I work out for three minutes each day.  

Tested on another friend:

> What a load of BS. Those fad high-intensity workouts don’t really work in the long term. They obviously must have really cut down on their calorie intake.
