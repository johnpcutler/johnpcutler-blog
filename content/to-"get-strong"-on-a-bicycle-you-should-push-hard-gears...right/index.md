To “get strong” on a bicycle you should push hard gears…right? Nope. It turns out that road cycling (where you can self-select your cadence because you have gears) isn’t a strength limited sport. It is predominantly an endurance sport where strength/weight reigns supreme. Lifting heavy weights (low reps) in the gym can help your “jump” in a sprinting situation by improving maximal force production, but the jury is out on doing hundreds of reps in a hard gear.
