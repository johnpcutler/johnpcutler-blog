I often hear versions of this question:

> Where is the team spending its time?

The question is fundamentally flawed. 

The question assumes that investment of time _equals_ investment in focused energy, and that that is simply not the case in knowledge work. All hours are not created equal. Consider that lethargic hour after a too-big lunch (“I couldn’t connect the dots”), or the extremely fruitful ten minutes after a refreshing walk (“it all came together!”).
