-   Unmerged code/design
-   Build without measure / learn
-   Plans without action
-   Work not in customer hands
-   Toxicity left unaddressed
-   Unused features
-   ”Done” not released
-   Blocking impediments
-   Work with no materialized business value
-   Unmet opportunities “on radar”
-   Un-retroed tensions
-   Un-triaged (valuable) customer feedback
-   Gaps between “official” culture and action

Unaddressed / “leaking” threats
