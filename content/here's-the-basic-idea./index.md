Here’s the basic idea.

-   In less than ten seconds, any person in a company should be able to give you a satisfying answer to the question “what is your team’s current mission?”.
-   There’s an art to this, and it takes practice and tweaking. A perfectly crafted mission tweet will satisfy nearly everyone (including customers).
-   There’s no need to constrains these to a month, or quarter.
