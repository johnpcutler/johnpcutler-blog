I’ve been thinking lately about the Kanban Method principle “Start with what you do now”. The idea with SWWYDN [is as follows](http://www.djaa.com/principles-kanban-method-0):

> The Kanban Method does not ask you to change your process. It is based on the concept that you evolve your current process. There is no sweeping, engineered change to a new process definition or style of working.

With SWWYDN, by starting with what you do now, and “agree\[ing\] to pursue incremental, evolutionary change”, the team is able to inspect and adapt as necessary. In theory (and in practice, as I have observed), this avoids some of the pitfalls of “Big Bang” change. Instead of going “all in” optimizing for the current challenge, you learn (and practice) as a team how to tackle whatever challenge comes your way. 

I believe wholeheartedly in SWWYDN. I personally find it very powerful (in work, and in my personal life). But it does have its challenges. In this post I’m going to address a couple of those \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

1.  Different people will have very different perspectives on “how things work”. My “we just work it out” may be your “HIPPO-driven meeting”. My “bugs are dealt with quickly” may be your “we have major quality issues extending back many years, and all we do is put out fires”. So it can hard to nail to what is _actually_ happening. 
2.  In most environments, people have opinions on how they would like to change things. I’ve found that most “stagnant” systems are better described as a highly dynamic stalemate between multiple opposing change agendas. It can be tempting, therefore, to describe this new aspirational state instead of outlining the current reality (especially when the current reality is vague and difficult to describe). 
3.  Describing the current state may be too politically charged, sensitive, and/or deflating. The team (or some part of the team or management) has likely “hired” the Kanban Method for a reason, and that reason is typically some change from the status quo. Revisiting the status quo feels like rummaging through the garbage and opening up old wounds. 
4.  Describing how a team works  —  especially if the team has no current (and explicit) working agreements  —  can be very difficult and time consuming. How do you describe “sometimes, someone gets freaked out by the scope of the project and asks that we have a full-team meeting with key stakeholders”?
