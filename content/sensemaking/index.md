Sensemaking

> In one application, sensemaking is approached as the ability or attempt to make sense of an ambiguous situation. More exactly, sensemaking is the process of creating situational awareness and [understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding "Understanding") in situations of high complexity or uncertainty in order to make decisions. It is “a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively” ([Klein et al., 2006a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking#Reference-Klein.2C_G..2C_Moon.2C_B._and_Hoffman.2C_R.F._2006a)).
