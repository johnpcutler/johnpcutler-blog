In the last couple weeks I have spoken to over fifty product development teams. It has been an incredible experience. There are many takeaways I’d like to share (and many strands of ideas I need to mull over and connect), but one takeaway in particular stands out:

Our organizations are structured and designed around the fragile illusion of certainty. Our environments are far from certain. Therefore, there’s a mismatch between what our organizations are optimized for, and the environments we’re attempting to navigate.
