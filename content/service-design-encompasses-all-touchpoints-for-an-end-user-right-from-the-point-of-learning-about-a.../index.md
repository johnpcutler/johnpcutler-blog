Service design encompasses all touchpoints for an end-user right from the point of learning about a brand to all mediums of interaction whether it is digital or real-world. Service design looks at improvising overall experience of the user in entire service delivery and is multi-disciplinary so its design involves not just designers and technologists but many more participants who understand the entire service delivery process and its various customer journey maps thereby improvising and linking all aspects together ([source](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/73868/what-is-the-difference-between-ux-design-and-service-design))

However, search online for service design right now and you’ll find a seemingly endless array of ‘toolkits’ and ‘design processes’. Five circled grids. Double diamonds. Mental models. You’d be forgiven for thinking that it was about the process of design, rather than changing outcomes for users. To a user, a service is simple. It’s something that helps them to do something — like learn to drive, buy a house, or become a childminder. ([source](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/18/what-we-mean-by-service-design/))

It’s a practice that lives in-between others — it lies not in simply the design of the check-in kiosk or the boarding pass, but in the integration of all of those into one total experience.

Services should be designed to deliver a unified and efficient system rather than component-by-component which can lead to poor overall service performance. ([source](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-principles-of-service-design-thinking-building-better-services))

The latest research on services states that value is created through a co-creation process between the organisation and their customers. This theory is called service-dominant logic. According to this view, placing customer value and business value against each other is not constructive ([source](https://medium.com/human-to-human-stories/this-is-not-service-design-7dc5ad22811a#.cnzkxpfdt))

Service blueprinting helps you see the experience a customer has with your service from a holistic viewpoint. It gives you not just the end-to-end view of the experience, but also exposes the “behind-the-scenes” work that goes into creating and delivering that experience. This surface-to-core information — the underlying actors, systems, touchpoints, policies — is critical to understanding and improving our services.
