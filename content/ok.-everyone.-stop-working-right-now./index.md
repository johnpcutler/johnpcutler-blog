OK. Everyone. Stop working right now.

Do a brain/Jira/Gcal/notebook/email inbox dump. What are you working on? What are you on the hook for? What promises/agreements have you made? What meetings do you attend? How does that stuff connect to and depend on other stuff? How does it “nest” into larger initiatives? What are your to-do lists? How do things get into that list? What does “done” look like for you? Where does your time go? How do you define “value” in your context?

Cool. Visualize/clarify everything. Stickies on the wall. You’ll have work, lists/queues, buffers, dependencies, groupings, agreements, meetings, stages/phases, steps, people, machines etc. You may even have things like budgets, goals, etc. Get it all up there.

Wait. You’re not done. I guarantee there’s all kinds of invisible work floating around that folks have kept more opaque for whatever reason…all the side projects, “good ideas we should explore”, and speaker slides for the industry conference. That goes up there too. Cool. Now you’re done (with this part).

OK. Imagine that your company has a road/highway running throught it that carries valuable goods from point A to point B. Or perhaps better yet a mystical lifeforce that, while powerful, is not unlimited in nature. It’s tempting to imagine that this lifeforce is directly proportional to the number of people who work at your company … more people = more stuff gets done. Or the highway … more lanes = more throughput. But that is not the case. 

There’s all sorts of space between the work … waiting, multi-tasking, interruptions,
