Some quick story writing / slicing tips.

Picture your user at their device (phone, laptop, etc.) Now, imagine a coworker or family member shouting from across the room:

> Hey, can you \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for me?

Note how this puts an emphasis on the user’s goal and not the solution.

Let’s take an example:

> Hey John, can you filter that table by the transaction type column header?

Hmmm. That doesn’t really have a ring to it. 

> Hey John, what was our largest grocery bill in June?

…feels a bit more actionable.

Now, having a table with transactions, sort capabilities, and filters MAY be the way to achieve that goal. But there are other potential solutions here. You might have more luck with a card-based model (with a card and drill down for each expense type).
