The three “foundational principals” of the [Kanban Method](http://www.djaa.com/principles-kanban-method-0) are as follows:

1.  Start with what you do now
2.  Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
3.  Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities & titles

#1 and #3 are very similar if you think about it (provided, of course, that the team currently respects the current process, roles, responsibilities & titles…which might not be the case).

Why start with what you do now, if you’re confident things will change?
