I frequently hear people debate the following:

> Tech doesn’t matter unless you get the product right! An amazing engineering team building crap better/faster will not make a product great. 

Vs.

> You can have the best product and design in the world, but if your tech is blowing up and you can’t execute…you’ll be dead on arrival.
