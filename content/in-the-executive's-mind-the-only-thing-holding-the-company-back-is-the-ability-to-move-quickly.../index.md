> If only we could execute ….

In the executive’s mind, the only thing holding the company back is the ability to move quickly, ship more stuff, and execute on “the strategy”. “We are going too slow” becomes the organization’s broken record excuse.

> We used to move so fast …

But maybe that’s the problem! How much of the early success was just plain luck? Did you really need to add all of that complexity? Also…adding “new stuff” is often a good bit easier than grappling with “old code”. Greenfield is sexy and success-theater friendly.

> We just need the right people in the right roles…

Are you promoting people internally? No? What message does that send? This tends to ignore the trouble caused by a small number of high level executives that are toxic but “perform too well to let go.” The “right people” are people who can 1) handle the legacy toxic people and 2) insulate the team from those toxic people.
