What does **awesome** look like?

> More predictability! More accountability!

Assume you have those things, what does it get you?

> Fewer surprises. We can make our commitments. Things will work more smoothly, and we can plan better.

Iâ€™m kind of missing the **awesome** here. How about the _good_ kind of surprises?
