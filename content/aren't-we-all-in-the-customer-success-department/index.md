Aren’t we all in the **Customer Success** department?

All of us. Engineers. Product Managers. UX. Support. Maybe even Sales and Marketing. Seriously, step back and view everything you do as a company. Let’s call this the capital “P” Product. The **Product** encompasses every touchpoint, interaction, swipe, call, click, event, conference booth, and help article. Is a restaurant’s food the _whole_ product? When we fly are we only _using the product_ when we’re strapped into our seat? 

At times if feels like we are hopelessly tied to old models of delivering hard goods.
