So let’s say I create an “open” (less prescriptive) framework. Wherever there are gaps, I can expect more prescriptive patterns to emerge among the community of users. Hopefully, the framework’s “core principles” will inspire reasonable patterns…but I can’t guarantee that (even if I myself add the pattern to the “core” framework and/or certify practitioners). One thing is for certain…**patterns will emerge from frameworks, and future frameworks will emerge from patterns/practices.**

Patterns (and gaps) emerge in 1) teaching/learning situations, 2) abuse/control situations, 3) buying and selling situations and 4) new/changing contexts. 

For example, when we see new users struggle, we add patterns to “scaffold” their learning until the guardrail policies are no longer needed. Or when some generative principle is frequently abused, we add “rules” to prevent that abuse. Finally…you’ll always have buyers interested in “exactly how do you operationalize this”, and that need will be dutifully filled by consultants, authors, etc.

It makes no difference whether the framework can be described in 100 words, nineteen pages, or eight-hundred pages… the patterns will exist somewhere (baked explicitly into the framework, formalized in “official” patterns, tucked into a presentation on the consultants laptop, or passed team-to-team as part of the tribal knowledge). **Any successful framework will spawn patterns. And most successful frameworks are themselves patterns connected to an even higher level framework.**

Of course this gets super messy. It can be difficult to…

-   differentiate between rules, principles, policies, guidelines, scaffolding, heuristics, and “patterns”.
-   discern intent (e.g. control, inspiration, forcing function, helpful constraint, safety, teaching, abuse prevention, etc.)
-   understand the relevant context (e.g. this pattern was created to handle working in “highly regulated environments”)
-   place the pattern in the context of the “parent” framework (e.g. this patterns supports the principle “make safety a prerequisite”)

Most of the framework “debates” I observe (and take part in) are complicated by these issues.
