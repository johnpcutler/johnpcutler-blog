A problem I see over and over…

Continuous improvement work (e.g. tuning working agreements, meeting design, improving team health, removing impediments, etc.) is a second-class citizen. It is not considered “real work”. It is not “tracked”. When push comes to shove it takes a backseat. Explained a software developer to me recently:

> We end up talking about the same shit over and over in our retrospectives. And never really do anything about it — especially if it extends to stuff outside the team. We try. But it is so hard to focus on that stuff when you have deadlines and actual work to do.

In many organizations, deciding on what to fix (and how to fix it) is the exclusive domain of managers. Of course that involves _listening (_and running obligatory engagement surveys). And on some level, protecting teams and individuals — _so that they can focus — _is a noble pursuit. But it tends to be kept very opaque…the stuff of 1:1s and small meetings.

Some front-liners actually prefer this. This type of work is not _fun and challenging._ It is messy. The work is _above_ their pay-grade.
