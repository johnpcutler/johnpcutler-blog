-   Ad-hoc group problem solving (e.g. swarming at a whiteboard, pairing, etc.)
-   Whole team interacting with customers/users (not just PM/UX)
-   Overall, fewer proxies and go-betweens 
-   Fewer reactive fire drills. Longer periods of flow/productivity
-   _Messier_ meetings…more divergence, challenging, trying multiple approaches
-   Clear sense of how day-to-day work fits into the “bigger picture”
-   Team-specific goals vs. individual backlogs/goals, etc. 
-   Ability to resolve issues “out in the open” instead of 1:1s, or through manager
-   More unstructured slack time than usual. Not accounting for every _minute_ of work
-   Less problem decomposition upstream. Team tackles unpacks problems together
-   Team fluent in the mechanics/terminology of the business
-   New, less-experienced team members up to speed/productive quickly
-   Outcome oriented stopping functions vs. output oriented stopping functions
-   Referrals. Team members actively recruit ex-teammates from prior jobs
-
