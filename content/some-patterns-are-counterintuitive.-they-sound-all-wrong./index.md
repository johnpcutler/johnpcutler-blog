-   Some patterns are counterintuitive. They sound all wrong.
-   Some patterns are outdated. They are no longer state of the art.
-   Some patterns are easily abused. Some are not.
-   The boundaries between patterns are often amorphous.
-   Some patterns are descriptive. Some patterns are prescriptive.
-   Some patterns are only helpful in certain contexts. Some are transferable.
-   Some patterns act as “interfaces” to those outside of your team/system.

Some patterns exist, but no one can explain how they work, or how to do it.

Most patterns have prerequisite conditions/learning/experience

Some patterns have directed relationships (e.g. do this, and then \_\_\_)

Most patterns are “not enough” when used in isolation.

Some patterns are designed to be localized/customized/adapted.

Patterns represent perturbations in a complex, sociotechnical system.

Patterns become part of a dynamic system when used/considered

Some patterns are designed to be used only as is, with no modifications.

Some patterns contradict/conflict with other patterns.

Some patterns are designed to be outgrown and discarded.

Some patterns will be a constant source of learning and practice.

Some patterns exist purely to select other patterns.

Some patterns exist purely to learn and support other patterns.

Some patterns exist purely to sense the impact of other patterns.

Some patterns are broadly applicable. Some are narrowly applicable.

Some patterns serve merely to guide the future creation of other patterns.

A pattern will be uniquely useful to all actors in the system.

Some patterns are “co-designed” and support double-loop learning.

Some patterns are under “active development”. Some are not.

Patterns are “simple, complicated, complex, and chaotic”.

Any “intervention” can be an act of sensemaking (and feed other patterns).
