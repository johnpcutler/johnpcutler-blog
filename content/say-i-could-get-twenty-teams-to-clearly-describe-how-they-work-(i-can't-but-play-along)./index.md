Say I could get twenty teams to clearly describe how they work (I can’t, but play along). Imagine I could inspire them to write books [like Basecamp’s Ryan Singer](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) but for their companies. What might we learn?

We’d probably learn about how context dictates practice. If the stories were good, we’d learn about how the team hit roadblocks, learned, and iterated on how they worked.
