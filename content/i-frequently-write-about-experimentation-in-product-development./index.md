I frequently write about experimentation in product development. 

If you’ve read my posts on Medium, you’re probably also familiar with my interest in continuous improvement and “experimenting” with how we work. 

What is fascinating to me is that experimentation in product development — with some nudging and stories/examples — usually goes over well. It “makes sense”, even if the details feel foreign and “risky”. 

Continuously improving _how_ we work, however, is a different beast. It is common for product teams to conduct retrospectives. Some even manage to run experiments to address issues raised in those retrospectives. Where things get messy is any time these issues extend beyond the immediate team (or in the case where the immediate team is more a grouping of individuals with their own projects, and little (if any) cross-member collaboration). 

The Why varies, but a key culprit is org structure. The standard approach for dealing with more far-reaching issues is for managers (and their managers) to sort it out. Have a problem? Bring it up to your manager, and they’ll go to bat on your behalf (in theory).
