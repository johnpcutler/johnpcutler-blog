How many _learning cycles_ have you experienced in your career?

> I’m learning all the time!

But are you really? A good amount of our day-to-day work is heads-down work. We’re on autopilot. We are _executing_.

I recently asked this question to a CTO in the midst of a large “transformation” in his organization. How many transformations did he have under his belt?

> Wow. This big? Maybe two? This is a bit uncharted.

So while learning every day, this CTO had experience two learning cycles for organizational transformation…in his two decade career.
