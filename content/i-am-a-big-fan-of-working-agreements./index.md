I am a big fan of Working Agreements. 

How do working agreements differ from _process?_ Do they?

Working Agreements might dictate process (e.g. we agree to do things in a certain order), or we might have a process for establishing Working Agreements (e.g. we agree to meet every other Thursday to review our working agreements), but there is a difference. 

Agreements are, well, _agreements_.

When people describe a process, they typically describe steps: Do X this way, do Y this way, and when X and Y are complete do Z. Then they describe areas of responsibility…Person A is responsible for X, Person B is responsible for Y. I know this probably seems trivial, but notice the difference when something is framed as:

> When X happens, I agree to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
