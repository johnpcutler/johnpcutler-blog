-   are the puzzlers, makers, designers, crafters, entrepreneurs, and change agents
-   Believe the real _rockstars_, mini-or-10x-anythings are supporting their teams
-   reject the “feature factory” and shipping for shipping’s sake
-   see lasting value and meaningful learning are the key units of value
-   embrace minimalism and pragmatism — “maximizing the amount of work not done”
-   work to positively impact everyone in the ecosystem — the team, community, customers, investors
-   care about impact, not hacks, Focus on the long term, not the short term. Focus on the inputs not targets and exhortations. Product and engineering, not just marketing eyeballs
-   thrive in cross-functional teams, in all their weird, geeky, and diverse glory
-   embrace uncertainty. It’s where opportunity lurks
-   can’t be boxed into an org chart (or titles), and routinely challenge professional stereotypes
-   work best when we have direct access to users, customers, and data
-   understand that all ways (e.g. Agile, Design Thinking) are _necessarily_ incomplete
-   use “just enough” process, and not more…always seeking minimalism and flexibility
-   seek out best practices, but know they’re just a beginning. We borrow liberally
-   work to uplevel our teams — coach, mentor, teach, speak, pair, and book club
-     
    
-   invite instead of impose, show instead of tell
-     
    
-   work to build trust and psychological safety on our teams
-     
    
-   above all, stay curious, stay humble, and keep learning
