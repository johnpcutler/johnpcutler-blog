1.  The town-hall was opened with a story
2.  No sugar coating.

  

“Everything is so complex!” “Less talking more doing!”

Use the firefighter check in as an example. It worked!

Brief, calm, credible, knowledgeable, and assuring.

They didn’t sugar coat. Healthy balance of progress and transparency

They used data — fuel supplies, % contained, weather, progress

Explained their assumptions, and how plans mapped to assumptions

Had a “structure” for the talk. Use same data points over and over

Included specialists from the respective areas

Explained the dynamics…the fuel, wind, prior fires, temps

Shared contingency plans, and when they would activate them

Answered the likely questions

It struck that balance.

They also included how we could help. 

Compare this to how we often talk about progress

Some report “too much sugar-coating”. Arbitrary decisions

Too dumbed down. Or inaccessible.

We cast a complex situation as “simple” or as “chaotic”
