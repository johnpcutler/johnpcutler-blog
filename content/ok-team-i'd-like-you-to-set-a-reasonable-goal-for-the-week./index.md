OK team, I’d like you to set a reasonable goal for the week. When the week is up, we’ll chat about how things went.

> Hmmm. What does Barbara mean by reasonable? Should we be 100% sure that we can hit the goal? If we do hit the goal, what will happen the following week? Shit does happen. If something goes wrong, will Barbara be OK with us missing the goal? What if we’re a bit unsure? Should we still make a commitment? 

I want you to be sure to bubble up any impediments, it is my job to clear those impediments!

> Barbara says that, but we know there are certain things she can’t change. We keep mentioning them, and nothing seems to happen. Is it reasonable to keep mentioning them? Is it unfair to Barbara? Also, what if my impediment is a coworker? I don’t want to alienate anyone, and sometimes it feels like staying quiet is the best option. What if my impediment is Barbara? Also, sometimes you have a gut feeling about something. Something feels off, but there is nothing immediately actionable. Should I raise those issues?
