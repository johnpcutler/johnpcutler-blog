This is the first sentence of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Depending on who you ask (and when you ask), the rest of the manifesto sits somewhere between life altering and common sense.

-   Agile is the values and principles listed in the manifesto, orâ€¦
-   Agile is the continuous pursuit of _better ways_ through practice (doing), collaboration, and learning (uncovering).
