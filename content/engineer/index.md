Who typically wins these discussions in your organization? PMs have the advantage of factoring hard numbers (and/or angry stakeholders) into the conversation. Engineers have a sinking feeling things are moving in the wrong direction. Both want to be responsive and “customer first”.

It can get downright dysfunctional:

-   **PM:** It is the engineering team’s responsibility to bring this stuff up!
-   **SM:** But they did! They’ve been mentioning it for a while.
-   **PM:** But they didn’t give estimates. They didn’t break it down. They didn’t make a case!
-   SM: They did, and you said it simply wasn’t valuable.
-   PM: Well, you see how slow we’re going
-   SM: That’s because they’re battling this debt!

Take this seriously when it happens. Consider ….

-   Is everything you ship valuable? Have you validated that?
-   Is velocity a problem? Is it your _biggest_ problem? If so, why is progress slow? In many cases, things are slow because you’ve cut corners in the past.
-   Can you do more to put a dollar figure on the risk of things exploding? Let’s say you needed to triple the size of your time to make 1.5x the progress. What if you hit a point where no new feature development can happen because you need to do a big bang rewrite? Are you considering the often complexity impacts progress in a nonlinear way?

Broadly. Give the team an opportunity to make an economic case for not cutting corners, and don’t discount it. What is the cost of not fixing this now? How about later? Then consider the human angle. What impact does this have on your team’s pride in their work?

Do a reality check with yourself as well. Is it possible to ship less and achieve the same outcomes with your customers?
