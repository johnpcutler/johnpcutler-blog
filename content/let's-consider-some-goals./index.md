Let’s consider some goals. 

-   Close $100,000 in new business in the next 30 days.
-   Deliver a usable version of this prototype in the next 30 days.
-   In the next 30 days, make it possible for our customers to do X.
-   We expect you to complete 80 story points in the next 7 days.
-   Increase this product usage metric from X to Y in 30 days or less.
-   Generate an additional $9,000,000 in revenue in the next 12 months.
-   For this quarter, we will really need to go “above and beyond”.
-   During the next 30 days, make “consistent progress” on the project.
-   For the next quarter, our focus is on improving predictability and increasing velocity.
-   We need a flashy feature to show at the customer conference in 60 days. We really need to “turn some heads.”
