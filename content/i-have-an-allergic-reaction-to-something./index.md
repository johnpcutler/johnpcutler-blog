I have an allergic reaction to something. 

Someone will be talking about “strong product leadership” or “strong design leadership” and I’ll find myself wincing. It’s weird because I’m not intrinsically anti-leadership (or management, or hierarchy, etc.) And I love product and design. There’s something else going on (with me). Say I hear…

Person: We need **STRONGER** product management

What they’re typically saying is that they want product management to be more forceful in counterbalancing other disciplines (e.g. Sales, Engineering, etc.) They’re looking for advocacy, “pushing back”, and representation.
