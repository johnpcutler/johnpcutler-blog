I’m not sure executives/managers fully comprehend the impact that having these beliefs (even thinking these things!) has on their behavior. Despite their best efforts, it tends to ooze from every pore. Which leaves them with a self-fulfilling prophecy: teams and individuals conform to their expectations.

They may not be right to start, but they’ll be _right_ eventually. 

The ironic thing is that most execs have been “on the other side”. As front-liners, they’ve sensed the lack of trust and confidence emanating from an executive, and hated it. They may be experiencing the _exact same thing at this very moment_ with people they report to_._ So this is well-worn  —  and _very_ human  —  territory. It’s hard, and it’s not just an executive thing. We all convey our thoughts/fears/concerns in our actions.

But…

Executive behavior has a large blast radius.
