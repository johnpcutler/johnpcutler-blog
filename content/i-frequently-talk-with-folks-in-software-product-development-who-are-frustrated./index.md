I frequently talk with folks in software product development who are frustrated.

1.  Their organization is taking a short-term view
2.  They are under constant pressure to cut corners
3.  Management is inflexible when it comes to trying new things
4.  They don’t feel like they can fully practice (and expand) their craft
5.  They feel a general sense of restlessness. They feel “trapped in the machine”

My circle tends to skew a bit older, so I do talk to people with a tad more experience. Maybe I attract a certain angsty crowd (selection bias). But it all got me thinking.
