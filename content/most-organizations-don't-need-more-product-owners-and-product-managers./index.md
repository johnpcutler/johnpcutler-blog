Most organizations don’t need more product owners and product managers. Why? They simply don’t have that many distinct value streams (aka products). There’s not enough to own and manage. 

Agile mandates cross-functional teams. So we dutifully assigned a product owner to a group of a 8–16 engineers. The question is … do those 8–16 engineers actually own a distinct outcome? In many situations the answer is no.
