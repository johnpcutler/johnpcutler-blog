OK. Thought experiment.Â 

The machine can do things like measure:

-   Energy investment (not just time investment)
-   Work transfer costs, impact of rework
-   When focus is split between two (or more) tasks
-   Signal vs. noise in feedback loops
-   Degree to which code quality impacts throughput
-   Morale, team cohesion, psychological safety, etc.
-   The return on investment (including overhead) for all enhancements, incentives, product complexity, processes, etc.
-   Network effects (e.g. team vs. individual alignment)
-
