There are three broad parts to continuous improvement:

1.  The continuous improvement “operating system”
2.  Problems and opportunities
3.  Interventions

#1 needs some explanation. What does the continuous improvement “operating system” actually do? Among many things:

-   Decides who participates and when/how (boundaries)
-   How problems and opportunities are explored and prioritized
-   Who needs to “approve” of interventions (if approval is required)
-   Change-in-progress limits (how much to change at once)

Importantly, this system (#1) is not about which specific problems to tackle, or how people intervene to try to fix those problems. A simple example might be how an individual team tackles continuous improvement:

-   Meet biweekly to discuss areas for improvement
-   Prioritize a problem area
-   Brainstorm some potential interventions, pick one, run the experiment
-   Chat about what worked/didn’t work at the start of the meeting
-   If problem is outside team, manager owns trying to resolve it for the team

You get the idea. This gets a good bit more complex when you’re talking about a whole organization. I recently asked a CEO about their approach to continuous improvement. This was there response:

> That’s really why we have managers…to catch that stuff. We also do employee reviews, and have an annual survey. Then there’s a learning and development team. Each of the groups has retrospectives, and if something is really pressing it bubbles up to me. 

All of that makes sense, but it isn’t very specific. How does it actually work?
