Sounds awesome. 

So first, we’re going to have to lay off the beer. Three per week, and they count towards your daily caloric intak

> Wow. OK. 

Here’s what a balanced 2000 calories looks like. You’ll eat this much six days a week, with one cheat day. 

> Oh goodness, that doesn’t look like much. But…OK. 

Eating healthy will require either regular (and more time intensive) visits to a good supermarket, or some kind of delivery service. You’ll be eating out less, but spending more on groceries. You good with that?

> I mean yeah. But…no, OK, I get it.

I’d like you to remove all screens from the bedroom. Use this alarm clock designed to wake you up gradually. To get the day off to a good start, try some gentle meditation/contemplation for 10–15 minutes before checking a screen. I know you’re into coffee, but let’s switch to tea for now.

> No coffee? No screens? How will I check the news or read myself to sleep? I have to admit I am having some doubts here. 

OK. Now for the exercise. Even with the restricted diet we are going to need to burn some calories and get you moving.
