I often advocate for approaches that are non-prescriptive _frameworks_ for broad engagement and continuous improvement. Actual “rules” are scarce (and high level), and oppportunities to customize and adapt are plentiful. These frameworks are the antithesis of “command and control”.

Here has been my personal challenge. 

First, when it comes to “fixing problems”, people tend to expect linear, concrete recommendations (e.g. “do this”). Presenting a framework can feel nebulous and non-concrete, even when it involves specific actions, rituals, and artifacts. It’s the classic “bring me solutions, not problems” dynamic, where a framework recommendation will come off as “just a lot of talking”. Because it doesn’t solve an immediate problem  —  it’s a framework for solving the immediate problem (and future problems), not the solution itself  —  you’ll lose people.

Second, you have to realize that most of these open frameworks fly in the face of traditional management, whereby it is the manager’s / leader’s job to resolve these tensions, and identify opportunities for improvement. This isn’t to say that managers don’t appreciate individual or team initiative. They do. But they tend to prefer a sense of spontaneity. “Why should the team need a framework to fix problems?!” “We already have too much process!” Continuous improvement frameworks put the focus on the collective, and add structure.

Third, and in a similar vein, anything that has a blast radius outside of the normal “team” unit of the org chart (e.g. a single 3–5 person product development team) is going to instantly feel dangerous and risky. What if things get out of hand? What if there is a groundswell of advocacy for something that management/leadership can’t (or doesn’t want to) fix?
