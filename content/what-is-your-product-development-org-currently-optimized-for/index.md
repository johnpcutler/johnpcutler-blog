What is your product development org currently optimized for?

For example, force rank the following criteria for your org:

1.  Short term growth
2.  Hiring the best and brightest engineers
3.  Customer retention

Assume that’s your ranking. What do you say to your support and success team? Deal with it? We’ve got your back? Keep up the good work folks, we’ll consider some headcount for next quarter?
