In a pull system, we don’t start something until we’ve “finished” something else. 

Take this post. I’m currently ignoring doing something else that is arguably more important, but I am writing this post anyway. I am NOT operating a pull system. 

I know an Ops team that routinely keeps taking on new work because various projects get blocked by external vendors. They’re starting without finishing.
