Does your team have adequate resources to create value for your customers?

When I ask people this question, they often reply with something like “well, we’re doing the best we can” or “no one has enough resources”. But when I press, they admit that their confidence level for producing _timely_ value is _low_. And that can be extremely frustrating.

Now, this doesn’t mean that the team is viewed as deficient or unresponsive. Doing your best — especially if times are “tight” — is all that anyone can ask for, right? As a professional, however, you know in your gut that the situation wont end well. The trajectory through the roadmap wont cut it.

I call this Minimally Viable Headcount (MVH). MVH is the minimal headcount required to deliver value for your particular value stream.
