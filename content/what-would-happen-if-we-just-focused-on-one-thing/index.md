What would happen if we just focused on one thing?

-   **It’s embarrassing saying “we can only do one thing at once”.** _Consider the impact of higher throughput. Is it better to talk about three things in progress, or stuff actually getting done?_
-   **Some of the specialist roles would have nothing to work on.** _Could they learn some new skills? Are you literally worried there is nothing to work on? _
-   **The meetings would be big, boring, and unwieldy.** _Perhaps. While that may not be feasible for daily/weekly meetings, it is possible  —  with solid facilitation  —  to have effective, large meetings. _
-   **The team would be too big. You can’t have a team with 5+ people.** _Most big boulders can be broken down. And…are you willing to sacrifice some inefficiency for progress (considering, also, that multi-tasking has its fair share of overhead). _
-   **Some of the work is done upstream. Would those folks sit around waiting for the “whole thing” to get done?** Why aren’t they involved, and what value are the handoffs delivering?
-   We’d be stepping on each other’s toes in the codebase. It would be difficult to divide up the work.
-   What if it turns out to take a long time? We’ll be waiting forever.
-   What if we’re sitting around waiting for customer feedback? What will people actually work on?
-   By assigning different things to different people, we have more accountability. It’s hard to gauge individual accountability (and performance manage individuals) if everyone is swarming on one thing.
-   We’re trying to nurture leaders, and working on “one thing” can only have one leader. What would the various managers / team leads do?
-   Some team members enjoy working on a solitary project. This would disrupt that for sure.
-   \[One person\] really doesn’t like working with \[Other person\].
-   That’s not a great project for \[new developer\]. They would be more suitable for \[some other thing\].
-   We’d really have to say “No” to new stuff and that’s super hard. It sucks to not be responsive.
-   What if something comes up and we can finish it super quick?
-   There would be product managers with nothing to do!
-   Work will still get in “through the cracks”. Not worth it.
-   We NEED \[person\] to keep handling those production issues.
