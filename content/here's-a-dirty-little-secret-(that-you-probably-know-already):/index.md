Here’s a dirty little secret (that you probably know already):

Many _so-called_ Agile teams fail to deliver a “[Done, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-in-scrum)” at the end of each sprint. They’re cheating. They aren’t playing by the rules!

Now an admission….

I’ve worked on awesome teams — “mature” teams — that fail in this regard. Why? Our external customers simply can’t _use_ what we can develop in a week or two. Sure the customer can provide some feedback, and/or do a usability test, but they can’t (yet) use the output of the increment to **get their day-to-day work done.**
