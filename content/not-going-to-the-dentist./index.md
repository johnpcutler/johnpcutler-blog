-   Not going to the dentist. Nothing is _obviously_ wrong. Time progresses. Now you’re pretty sure that something IS wrong, but the fear of figuring out how badly you screwed up…is freaking you out. So you put off going to the dentist, and your teeth keep getting worse.
-   You receive a _very important_ piece of mail. The house is disorganized, so you put the mail on your kitchen table (for fear of not being able to find it). When the kitchen table gets messy, you start piling the important mail _somewhere else._ This repeats until you can’t find anything, and start putting it in the car.
