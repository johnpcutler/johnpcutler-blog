Here’s a question for you. 

How quickly does your organization let go of underperforming managers and executives? 6 months? A year? A couple years? Never?

Now, how quickly does your organization let go of underperforming (so called) individual contributors or “front-liners”? 

Someone asked me this a couple years ago, and I immediately pushed back on the nature of the question…

> How do you measure performance?

> How do you know if it is their fault, versus the “system”? What about their boss? Or their boss’s boss? Or the person in sales who sold the bum deals?

> Isn’t there some value in giving people a chance?
