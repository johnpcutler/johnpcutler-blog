Team members spend a lot of time having circular 1:1 conversations that never really go anywhere. Politics makes it unsafe to discuss certain things publicly so people take it underground.

A lot of side-project starting, and not a lot of finishing. In political situations there is often buy-in on the need to act, but there are systemic issues which make addressing the root problem impossible. Committees and task forces are convened, goals set, but somehow nothing seems to pan out.

Team members leave the company.
