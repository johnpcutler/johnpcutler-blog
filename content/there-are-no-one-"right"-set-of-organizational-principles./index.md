There are no one “right” set of organizational principles. 

#### We trust each other to do the right thing

Provide input. Stay in the loop when you need that information to do your job. Clarify your involvement.

#### We are sensitive to the fact that our work will impact other teams

Check in. Be receptive to feedback. Give some warning. Be constructive and appropriate

#### We value having enough context and data to do a great job

Ask for it. If you don’t ask, no one will know it is important. Get to the Why. We are a diverse group. To have autonomy with diversity you need to spend time sharing context

#### We value a sense of flow in our work

Figure out why you’re stifled and try to work it out. Help others achieve flow

#### We value finishing over starting

Limit your work in progress. Push back on low-leverage projects

#### We value crisp and informed decision making

Have an owner. Get input. Test for some consensus, and decide. What did we decide?

#### We value succinct points of view over vague uncertainty

Come prepared with your data, insights, beliefs, and solutions

#### We are disciplined about our working agreements and team decisions

Take meeting notes. Record and refer to your working agreements. Invest in building shared understanding

#### We value just in time optimization and process

Worry about the problems we have now, and not the problems we might have later. Respect the people who bear the brunt of those sacrifices. Provide context

#### We value reminding people about these values

Just bring them up. Consistently apply them. Everybody’s job
