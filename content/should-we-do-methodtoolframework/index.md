Can you rollback the changes? Is it [safe-to-fail](http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/safe-to-fail-probes/)? Have you made safety a prerequisite? 

Have you [invited people to participate vs. imposing the change?](https://www.infoq.com/articles/inviting-over-imposing-agile)

Is there _some_ shared understanding about what _better_ might look like? 

What else have you tried? How did it go? What did you learn?

Have you considered other  —  perhaps simpler, less invasive  —  options? Is there someone out there getting the same outcome by doing less/simplifying further? List a couple alternative approaches. 

Have you researched the origin story for the approach? In most cases the “way” evolved from practice and experimentation. How does that messy/emergent original version differ from the current (possibly branded) version? What problem were they (the original experimenters) hoping to solve?

State and challenge any assumptions, especially ones starting with “\[that alternative to the thing\] can never work here because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_”. 

Have you gone on site with a team (hopefully a couple teams) trying It at other companies? What did you learn?

Are you prepared to invest the time and energy in making this work? Even a small change in how you work can sap 30–50% of your energy/focus for some period of time. Change is by nature not automatic  —  it’s a disruption of this status quo. It takes focus.
