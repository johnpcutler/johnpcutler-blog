### The Restart

Most people I personally know (and meet) in software product development are not _new_ to Agile. Heck, even the marketing, sales, support, success, and finance folks have some _rough_ idea of what happens when “the technies do Agile”. I have a lot of empathy for teams getting started with Agile ways for the first time , but that’s not who I typically interact with (outside of recent college graduates). For some tips on truly starting out without a coach, check out Ron Jeffries’ article [here](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/017-08ff/starting-out/).

Truth be told, some high percentage of the teams and individuals I interact with have been trying various Agile patterns (e.g. Scrum, XP, Kanban Method, etc.) for years and even decades. Many have received some kind of formal training (certification, even), and at a minimum have a reasonable sense of “how it works”…from actual experience/practice, books, videos, articles, formers coworkers, and former companies. Many have plateaued  —  they’ve hit a wall even while going through the motions —  while a handful have taken things to another level altogether and continue to improve (and expand beyond the walls of Agile itself).

 So how do you push through this plateau? 

1.  In a lot of cases there is something external to “the teams” that is holding everyone back

### The Books

Here’s a list of ten books that have a _reasonable chance_ of inspiring some valuable experiments. Buy them for the team (even if you have read them before) and start a small library. They’re worth the investment. Commit to buy more books on a regular basis.
