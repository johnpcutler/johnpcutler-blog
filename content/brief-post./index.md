Brief post.

Say your company is grappling with a stubborn, complex problem.

You’re going in circles: blame, mistrust, workarounds, well-meaning attempts to “fix this once and for all”, pragmatic adjustments, and two-steps-forward-thee-steps-back. 

The fixes don’t “stick”, and the situation reverts. 

My (totally obvious, but not to me) observation of the day…

Everyone is “right”! You can spend meeting after meeting hearing people accurately point out stuff that is “wrong”.
