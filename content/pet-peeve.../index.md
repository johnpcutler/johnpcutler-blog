Pet peeve…

**Tl;dr Stop giving your projects with vague, three word, non-descriptive, unhelpful, confusion inducing names.**

Try this test. First, pick an effort/project on your roadmap/backlog with a yummy name like **Accounting Revamp**, **Onboarding Redesign**, or **API Fixes Phase 2**.

Now, ask five random people to describe, in a short paragraph, what the effort is all about. What is in and out of scope? What’s the goal? When will you celebrate, or pivot? What segment of customers/users are you targeting with the change? How will their behavior change? You get the idea…

Now compare the paragraphs. Everyone is in alignment, right?

Maybe not. In my book, alignment starts (but by no means ends) with a good project name. It might mean super trivial, but project names get repeated over and over. So you have an opportunity there.

It’s at about this point when someone will say something like:

> But John, if we make the name too long, then it will not look right on this Jira dashboard, and the executive summary spreadsheet So we need to use shortcuts, you know?

> The engineers needed a shortcut. 

Suffice to say I have seen small teams  —  3–6 people  —  work for MONTHS on something while still lacking some basic understanding of what the “whole thing is about”. And these are small teams, let alone departments, and companies. 

So…

First, a product managers job is to build this shared understanding. The names of your initiatives, projects, efforts, etc. are a great place to start. I don’t want to dictate a format, but consider simple changes like:

-   Faster bank reconciliation (30 minutes to 5 minutes)
-   Zero to Hero Onboarding. From sign up to Analytics Master.
-   Reduce data sync errors by 30%

You get the idea. Now of course this will not solve the problem of building shared understanding around the details  —  that is hard, and is a main focus for PMs  —  but don’t shoot yourself in the foot right from the start. With just 4–6 words you should be able to get to the crux.
