> We just need more accountability. And a greater sense of urgency.

My impression  —  from talking to the team  —  is that they are overwhelmed trying to navigate all sorts of dependencies. They need some level of autonomy and independence. They’re justifiably a little hesitant about taking full accountability for these projects.

> How am I supposed to help them if they don’t surface those dependencies? I’m not sure they’ve earned that independence. Autonomy must be earned. 

I believe they _tried_ to surface these issues, and then _gave up_. It started to feel like a waste of time, retrospective after retrospective, document after document. I’ll admit their delivery is not as refined as your delivery when it comes to raising impediments. They may not know how to trace down root cause for these problems  —  something feels vaguely off, but it is hard to pin it down. They might need your help? They might feel a little nervous or embarrassed?

> Waste of time? All they were doing is bringing me problems and complaining. No solutions…

Except that time they brought a solution, and you shot it down it in a public forum in front of their peers, your peers, and your boss. That was demoralizing. There’s not a lot of incentive to stick your neck out after getting shut-down like that. I’m not sure that was the only time either.

> Their solution was embarrassing, honestly. At least in that important setting. Why didn’t they run it by me earlier? I could have helped them! I can’t advocate for the team if they keep surprising me!

Your calendar is booked two weeks out. It’s super hard to get your attention. When you do show up, it takes forever just to get you up to speed with what is actually happening.

> If they were more accountable, I wouldn’t need to spend as much time running air-cover for them. I could spend more time coaching and facilitating, instead of sitting in meetings saying “no, it’s not done yet!”

Do you trust them? You hired them, right?

> Oh I hired them and I trust them for the most part. I guess I was expecting them to be a bit more mature and proactive I’m not really seeing the leadership qualities I was hoping for. Or the level of detail-oriented-ness. And sometimes, I guess I wonder if they are giving their all. I remember when I was at that level ten years ago. We didn’t spend all day on Slack, I can tell you that. 

Have you spoken to them about this? Have you explained your expectations and concerns? What did they say?

> I guess. Sort of. But I feel pretty stupid laying it out like they are robots or something. I don’t want to put a box around them. For some of this…either you have it or you don’t, you know. I shouldn’t have to explain basic shit. So I’m more sort of watching and observing, and dropping the occasional hint. The

Maybe you should let them go? I mean it sounds like you’re saying they aren’t doing their job? 

> I can’t do that! It would reflect so badly on me. I could manage one or two of them out, but I can’t fire anyone. My boss would start to wonder. Plus, they aren’t really doing anything ALL that wrong. To be honest, I have some similar gripes.
