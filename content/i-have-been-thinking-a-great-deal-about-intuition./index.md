I have been thinking a great deal about intuition.

The other day I was observing a team decompose work. Something just smelled wrong. The slice of work felt off…overly complex, yet somewhat incomplete. I noticed how the team was stumbling as the team tried to form a cohesive goal for the increment of work.
