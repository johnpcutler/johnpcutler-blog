Tips for doing research on your one-pagers

1.  **Guessing**. If all you are doing is guessing, you are better off waiting to guess with other people. You’ll benefit from their diverse perspectives. If it is a crapshoot (even with more perspectives), then just agree to flip a coin.
2.  **UX/design** is a skill that takes many years to master (although it can appear deceptively simple, especially with B2B applications). Admittedly, it is fun to do…even for novices. 
3.  **Visual Brainstorming**. The purpose of visual brainstorming in groups isn’t to magically come up with “the answer”…rather it is to tease out assumptions, and build shared understanding (which is part of design). The end product typically looks nothing like the drawings on the wall.
4.  **Presentation matters**. Words matter. Frame efforts in terms of the outcome. Avoid calling projects by the solution name (e.g. SomeComponent). Paint a compelling picture at the kickoff. Think mission, not project.
5.  **Tools**. Things like customer journey mapping, customer interviews, usability testing the current app, jobs-to-be-done, card sorting, diary studies, ethnographic research, even lofi drawing…are all valuable tools. Learn them! Do them! But treat it all as data and input, not output.
6.  **Casting a Net**. Convergence and divergence make better products (both during the “exploration” phase, and the “exploitation” phase). The danger of going too deep on “convergent exploitation” — and rushing the other steps —is that it is common to get tunnel vision. Consider inviting a diverse crew to divergently explore with you.
7.  **Possibilities**. Offer solutions as “possible interventions”. Yes, you might have had the best idea (so far), but there may be better ideas out there. Actively invite better ideas. Start this list of ideas when you start researching. Have an idea? Put it on the list. This will keep the habit fresh.
8.  **Solution Depth**. Remember that solutions are multi-dimensional. It is easy to assume that the UI is “the solution”, but it is only part of the solution. How will it work technically? Can it be tested? What do the guts look like? Security? Invite the right voices to participate.
9.  **Data**. When offering solutions, be prepared to offer data. How do you know this is the best idea? What else have you tried? What tests did you run? 
10.  **Clear Winners**. Sometimes the data will point to a single, blatant, 100% winner solution. How awesome! The team will appreciate hearing about it, hearing about how you tested it, and hearing about how it solves the problem.
11.  **Criteria**. Establish the criteria for what a good solution would look like, before brainstorming solutions. Imagine you were on a judging panel for the “best” solution. How would you judge submissions? This helps de-bias your approach.
12.  **Working Small**. Batch size and releasing incrementally really matters. Meaning…that you should challenge any solution that only when works all the pieces “come together”. This is counterintuitive. “Why would we do something crappy in the near term if we just KNOW this is where we are going?” The reality is that frequent integration — getting something out there and testing it — is at the heart of modern product development. 
13.  **Working Small #2**. One of the challenges with prototyping in spreadsheets / paper, is that it is easy to accidentally generate a big batch. Can you simplify further? Can you show just one metric and get user feedback? It also has the potential to minimize all the hard work required to make that data available in the application, for daily production-quality use. 
14.  **The Right Resolution**. Remember, that most problems are nested solutions to higher level problems. Experiment with “going up a level” and “going down a level” until you find a mixture of assumptions and framing that feels right to the team.
