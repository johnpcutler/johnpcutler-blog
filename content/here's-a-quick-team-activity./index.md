Here’s a quick team activity. It is a slight variation on [Design the Box](http://gamestorming.com/design-the-box/), and [The Future, Backwards](http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/the-future-backwards/) (and a host similar team activities). 

This exercise is best done in the classic diverge/converge style. 

#### Setup

It is a month or two from now. The company is holding an all-hands. The team has been invited to present on initiative X (the current initiatives). There’s a huge screen, and the whole company is paying attention. One by one, team members stroll up to the front of the room. After some minor technical difficulties (and a joke about whether there are any engineers in the room), the presentation starts! Two slides in, you present a slide with actual quotes from customers, users, internal team members, press, etc.

I’m going to ask you to imagine three potential futures here. 

#### The Awesome Slide

Imagine a slide that absolutely floors people. Things have been going _super well_. 

Example:

> OMG. This is awesome! We’ve been able to cut down on annoying account reconciliation busy work by 75%, and see far fewer sync errors. What used to take multiple people a combined 12–18hrs, now takes under 3 hours! We love Team Acme! — SOME CUSTOMER

Or

> We had no idea whether customers even cared about importing activity data into the app. It was a big question mark. But with Team X’s work, I can now confidently say we have a potential revenue stream here. 82 customers imported one-billion activities into the system. And most importantly, they were willing to pay for it. This is a big day here at Acme. — SOME CEO

Imagine that these quotes are authentic, engaging, and powerful. **And (this is important) reasonably feasible given the 1–2 month time horizon.** Picture that crotchety skeptic in the back of the room  —  the person who calls BS on things constantly (often rightfully)  —  and even she is nodding. Picture the data scientists puzzling over the validity of the claim. Picture someone in customer support who deals with customers every day…does this hold any water? 

You get the idea: the story needs to resonate, be coherent, and be within the realm of possibility.

#### The Meh Slide

Now, imagine quotes that would elicit a tepid response (from one or more people in the audience). In **bold** I’ve added some imaginary responses to give you a better sense of the type of quote we’re looking for. Just write the quote. Examples:

> Customers really love this!  —  SOME SUPPORT REPRESENTATIVE

**But why? How do we know? Meh. **

> We migrated the data to Chumpbase  —  SOME TEAM MEMBER

**What did that let us do? Why Chumpbase? Did we rule out other options? How did our customers benefit? Meh.**

> The rapid-find feature is now in production!  —  SOME TEAM MEMBER

**Is it working? How about quick-find, the other option? We really wanted to try that option, but somehow we went with rapid-find? Meh. **

> Thanks for delivering rapid-find. In the next staff meeting I’ll let everyone know about it, and we’ll give you some feedback — SOME CUSTOMER

**Is that it? The good news is that they’ll try it? We have to do better than that. Meh.**

The idea here is to focus in on what would fall flat. Things fall flat for various reasons. Maybe there’s a political backstory. Maybe you’ve provided no data. Maybe the story simply isn’t all that compelling, and leaves the audience wondering “is this really the best way to spend our money?” Put on your skeptics hat for a bit. And then put on your empathetic hat. What will leave people thinking….meh?

#### Awesome (But Probably Out of Scope)

Finally, imagine some quotes that would be AMAZING…but just feel out scope. Perhaps they are a better fit for another initiative. Or maybe they just feel _too big, or can only happen down the road. This may be a bit tough to wrap your head around_

  

  

  

  

  

  

-   Awesome news!
-   Awesome news, but out of scope. 
-   Lackluster, demoralizing, meh news.
