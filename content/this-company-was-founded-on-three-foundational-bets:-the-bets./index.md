This company was founded on three foundational bets: \[the bets\].

The biggest leap of faith bet we are making at the moment is \[some bet\].

We are betting that as a company we need to be exceptionally good at\[one or two things\], which will come at the expense of being good at \[other things\].

Though it didn’t work out as planned, I think our bet to \[some intervention\] was the right thing to do given the available information. Since then we have learned that \[new information\], and have subsequently decided to \[some other intervention\].

Currently, we are betting that \[some intervention\] will \[some outcome/benefit\]. We’ll know we’re on the right track if we observe \[some leading indicator\].

A core bet is that we believe we can shift the status quo behavior from \[status quo\] to \[some new behavior\] which will benefit the customer/user by \[some benefit\] and the company by \[some benefit\]. We believe we can shift that behavior by \[some intervention\].

We are betting that a key competitor will flounder because \[reason\], and that our position is defensible to other entrants because \[reason(s)\].
