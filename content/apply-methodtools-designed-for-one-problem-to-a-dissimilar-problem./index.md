Apply \[method/tools\] designed for one problem, to a dissimilar problem. What happens? You might get lucky and stumble on something good. More likely…you get something less than optimal. 

Of course, we say this in retrospect. For example: early on, “building” software _looked and felt_ like building bridges, buildings, and hardware. That sensation likely didn’t last long for the people _doing the work_ (iterative development was happening as early as the 1950s), but to the casual eye the similarity lingered, and still lingers. Even those doing the work  —  and tweaking how they did they work  —  were constantly resetting the bar, and adjusting to new challenges.

You see the cycle repeating at different resolutions. Consider the challenge of delivering a service like Salesforce at scale (or Google, the iPhone, Intuit, Amazon, a government service ecosystem, etc.) compared to the challenge of delivering shrink-wrapped software 20 years ago. Yes, these problems share some core principles. But on many levels, it is a different game.

Now layer on a host of other related and supporting “problems” like accounting, management, risk analysis, sales, partner relations, and organizational design. These ancillary disciplines will likely require some sort of change, and to the casual eye they may sneakily resemble the “old” version of the problem (e.g. “we can fund software development exactly like we funded hardware projects”).

Thankfully, we are born tinkerers, especially when there’s an upside. Successful innovation in how we work is copied, packaged, and sold. There will always be a market among the mainstream and laggards for quick fix (aka “transformation”). The solution sold to the mainstream/laggards will almost by definition resemble a watered down, constrained, and prescriptive version of “the way” (aka a “starting point”). And to top it off, the silver-bullet will rarely touch all of the adjacent adaptations required for fundamental change…because that’s hard, messy, and hard to sell.

So it should come as no surprise that consulting firms are hocking Agile Transformations, and that there’s brisk demand for scaling frameworks, insta-Scrum, installing DevOps, etc. It is exactly what you’d expect in a competitive environment.

Similarly, we would expect to see push-back from those with deep roots in the tradition….and we do (the purist movements, back to basics, modern translations, etc.) You’d also expect to see organizations pushing the limits  —  pushing the state of the art  —  without directly associating their innovations to the various traditions (or even having an awareness of the traditions). And we see this too.
